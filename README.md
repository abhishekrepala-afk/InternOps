# InternOps – Workforce Management & Intern Operations Platform

**InternOps** is an enterprise-grade workforce management system designed for the Uptoskills ecosystem. It provides hierarchical role management, attendance tracking, performance ratings, social task assignments, and comprehensive audit logging. The platform enforces strict role-based access control and ownership validation across every operation.

## Features

- **Role Hierarchy** – Strict five-tier structure: Admin, Senior TL, TL, Captain, Intern. Every role has bounded visibility into subordinate data.
- **Authentication & Authorization** – JWT-based access and refresh tokens with rotation, Argon2 password hashing, brute-force protection, and per-request RBAC + ownership validation.
- **Attendance Management** – Single and bulk attendance marking with remarks. Monthly statistics and immutable audit trails.
- **Performance Ratings** – Role-gated rating system (Captain rates Intern, TL rates Captain, etc.). Full rating history is preserved without overwrites.
- **Social Tasks** – Admins and Senior TLs create platform-specific tasks with deadlines. Interns upload proof screenshots; Captains/TLs verify submissions. Images are automatically purged after 24 hours.
- **Notifications** – In-app notifications for attendance, ratings, and task events with read/unread tracking.
- **Meetings** – Hierarchical meeting scheduling with attendee management.
- **Reports & Exports** – Attendance summaries, rating summaries, task completion statistics, and CSV export capabilities.
- **Audit Logging** – Every sensitive action (login, attendance change, rating creation, role modification, etc.) is permanently logged with actor, action, target, and timestamp.
- **Session Management** – Users can view and revoke active sessions; admins can revoke any user's sessions.
- **Uptoskills Integration Ready** – Dedicated module with service placeholders for future API synchronization.
- **Swagger Documentation** – Interactive OpenAPI 3.0 documentation available at /docs.

## Architecture

The platform follows a layered architecture:

- **Web Server Layer** – Fastify with plugins for CORS, Helmet, rate limiting, multipart uploads, and static file serving.
- **Middleware Layer** – Authentication, role-based access control, ownership validation, CSRF protection, input sanitization.
- **Route Layer** – Modular Fastify route plugins for each feature domain.
- **Service Layer** – Business logic for authentication, password reset, hierarchy management, and Uptoskills integration.
- **Repository Layer** – Raw SQL queries via the pg driver; no ORM is used.
- **Database Layer** – PostgreSQL with UUID primary keys, foreign keys, indexes, and soft-delete support.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- PostgreSQL 15+ (or a Neon database connection string)
- Git

### 1. Clone the Repository

\\\ash
git clone https://github.com/rajat-wyrm/InternOps.git
cd InternOps
\\\

### 2. Install Dependencies

\\\ash
# Backend
cd backend
npm install
cd ..

# Frontend (optional)
cd frontend
npm install
cd ..
\\\

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file and fill in your values:

\\\ash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
\\\

Edit ackend/.env and set the required variables (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)).

### 4. Run Database Migrations and Seed

\\\ash
cd backend
npm run migrate
npm run seed
\\\

The seed script creates a default administrator account:
- Email: dmin@internops.com
- Password: Admin@123

### 5. Start the Backend Server

\\\ash
npm run dev
\\\

The API server will start on http://localhost:5000. Swagger UI is available at http://localhost:5000/docs.

### 6. Start the Frontend (Optional)

\\\ash
cd frontend
npm run dev
\\\

The frontend runs on http://localhost:5173 and proxies API requests to the backend.

## Database Schema

The system uses PostgreSQL with UUID primary keys and soft-delete columns (deleted_at). Key tables include:

- users – User accounts with role, manager hierarchy, department, and suspension status.
- departments – Department names and creators.
- ttendance – Immutable attendance records with status (Present/Absent/Half-day) and remarks.
- 
atings – Permanent rating history with score (1-5), reviewer, and remarks.
- social_tasks – Task definitions with deadlines and target platforms.
- proof_submissions – Image uploads linked to tasks, with verification status.
- 
otifications – In-app notification messages per user.
- udit_logs – Complete history of all sensitive actions.
- meetings – Scheduled meetings with attendees.
- 
efresh_tokens – JWT refresh token store.
- login_attempts – Brute-force tracking table.

All tables use foreign keys and indexes for referential integrity and performance.

## Security

The platform implements multiple layers of security:

- **Authentication** – JWT access tokens (15 min) and refresh tokens (7 days) with rotation. Argon2 password hashing.
- **Authorization** – RBAC middleware checks user role; ownership middleware validates hierarchical access on every request.
- **Brute-Force Protection** – Login attempts are tracked per email and IP; accounts are temporarily locked after 5 failures within 15 minutes.
- **CSRF Protection** – All state-changing requests require an X-CSRF-Token header.
- **Rate Limiting** – General rate limiting (100 requests/min) and stricter limits on authentication routes (5 requests/min).
- **Helmet** – Sets secure HTTP headers (CSP, HSTS, XSS protection, etc.).
- **Input Sanitization** – Strips HTML tags and quotes from incoming data to prevent XSS and SQL injection.
- **File Upload Validation** – MIME type and extension whitelisting, unique filenames (UUID), size limits.
- **Audit Logging** – Immutable log of every sensitive action with actor, target, old/new values, IP, and user agent.

## Uptoskills Integration

A dedicated integration module (ackend/src/modules/uptoskills) provides placeholder service functions and an endpoint. Developers can implement the actual synchronization by filling in the following stubs:

- getInternsFromUptoskills()
- getDepartmentsFromUptoskills()
- syncUsers()
- syncAttendance()
- syncProjects()

All URLs and API keys are configured via environment variables (UPTOSKILLS_BASE_URL, UPTOSKILLS_API_KEY).

## Testing

The backend can be tested using the comprehensive PowerShell diagnostic script located in the project root. It verifies:

- Server health and connectivity
- Authentication flow (login, CSRF, token refresh)
- All protected endpoints with valid tokens
- Database connectivity and schema
- Middleware behavior (RBAC, ownership)

To run the test suite:

\\\powershell
# From the project root (C:\Users\rajat\InternOps)
.\scripts\full-test.ps1
\\\

## Deployment

### Production Considerations

- Set NODE_ENV=production in the .env file.
- Use a strong JWT_SECRET and rotate it periodically.
- Configure CORS_ORIGIN to the exact production frontend URL.
- Set up a process manager (e.g., PM2) to keep the Node.js server running.
- Use a reverse proxy (Nginx, Traefik) for SSL termination.
- Run migrations as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
- Regularly backup the PostgreSQL database.

### Sample PM2 Configuration

\\\ash
npm install -g pm2
pm2 start backend/src/app.js --name internops --env production
pm2 save
pm2 startup
\\\
